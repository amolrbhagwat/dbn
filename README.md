# dbn
Database Navigator built in C#

## What is it?
A Windows program to connect to, and view data stored in databases.

## Why dbn?
For common tasks such as lookup and browsing, dbn eliminates the need to write SQL.

The key feature of dbn is the ability to view data in other tables which have the same field and value as the the record you are interested in. This makes it easy to cross-check data when investigating issues with queries which comprise of multiple table joins.

## What's currently supported?
- Connecting to MySql databases (more coming soon!)
- Fetching all (textual) data from a table
- Fetching data from a table which matches certain criteria
- Lookup matching data in other tables
